# Phrase Hunter

This project is a browser-based, word guessing game named "Phrase Hunter." JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) are used to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on the user's keyboard or the onscreen one.

Using JavaScript, two classes with specific properties and methods are used to manage the game.

The code chooses a random phrase, splits the phrase into letters, and put those letters onto the gameboard on the screen.

Each time the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen.

A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears.

A player can guess a letter only once. After theyâ€™ve guessed a letter, your programming will need to disable that letter on the onscreen keyboard.
